# Cars Portfolio

This project was created as a car portfolio to show to users.

## Tools used

* Angular (version 8).
* Angular Material (version 8).
* Flex Layout (version 8).
* NGXS (version 3.5.1).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Opportunity for improvements

* Add better images `(assets/cars)` because the project is focused on other things, not images.
* Create a `fake` server to retrieve the cars data.
* Add a tool to add more cars.

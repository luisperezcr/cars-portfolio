# Cars Portfolio

This project is a car portfolio to see different brand cars and models.

## Tools used

* Angular (version 8).
* Angular Material (version 8).
* Flex Layout (version 8).
* NGXS (version 3.5.1).

## Development server

In order to see the app locally, do the following:

1. Clone the repo to a local repo.
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
3. Run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
4. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Opportunity for improvements

* Add better images `(assets/cars)` because the project is focused on other things, not images.
* Create a `fake` server to retrieve the cars data.
* Add a tool to add more cars.
